# Section 1: Understanding Ansible Inventory

At the heart of Ansible's automation is inventory, which is the basic component used to describe the infrastructure that Ansible should interface with. The inventory can just be a list of destination machines on which Ansible will execute its tasks. It can also include groups of these destination machines and their associated variables to provide important configuration information.

## Types of Inventories

Ansible supports different types of inventories, each useful according to different scenarios.

### 1. Static Inventory
A static inventory is a flat textual file in which all hosts and groups are manually listed. Usually, it is formatted either in INI or YAML.

- **Pros**: Simple and easy to use. Ideal for small environments, or where infrastructure doesn't change frequently.
- **Cons**: The scalability doesn't work well once the number of hosts is increased. The host file has to be updated every time something in the infrastructure changes.

### 2. Dynamic Inventory
What makes an inventory dynamic is the fact that it enables Ansible to pull information from an outside source, for instance, a cloud provider such as AWS, Azure, or CMDB. This type of approach by its nature automatically takes care of the inventories in a very dynamic manner.

- **Pros**: Great in environments where infrastructure changes quickly. It saves manual work and, therefore, human error.
- **Cons**: It is harder to set up and maintain, which would be creating complexity when it comes to debugging and troubleshooting.

### 3. Hybrid Inventory
In some cases, a hybrid approach is used and includes both static and dynamic inventories. One can take advantage of this approach when part of the infrastructure is static, while another is highly dynamic.

- **Pros**: It is flexible such that you can manage different environments all under a single inventory framework.
- **Cons**: It can become complicated to support and eventually, require more complex organizational strategies.

## The Role of the Inventory in Ansible

The inventory file is really a core part of how Ansible works. The inventory file lets Ansible know what machines it has the potential to connect to, along with their IP addresses or hostnames, and what groups of machines those machines are part of. A third thing that inventories do in terms of function is that they can contain variables that are used by hosts or groups to determine how playbooks are to be run against those targets. For example, you might define a variable that would determine which web server software would be installed or the version of an application that's being deployed.

## Static vs. Dynamic Inventory: Choosing the Right Approach

The choice between a static and dynamic inventory depends mostly on the nature of your infrastructure:

- **When to Use Static Inventory**: 
In very small and stable infrastructures that practically do not change over time, a static inventory can be ideal. Easier setup, lower overhead.
  
- **When to Use Dynamic Inventory**: 
Dynamic inventories are much better in environments such as the cloud, where instances are often created and destroyed, and when maintaining a complex, large infrastructure. This is because they will handle the discovery of hosts and groups in an automated manner, so you would always be up-to-date without the need to do any work.

The basics of Ansible for complex deployments include mastery of an understanding of the inventory. The following section now focuses on how to neatly keep your inventory so that it is good for scaling up infrastructure and remains easily managed.
